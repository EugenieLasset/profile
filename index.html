  I'm 19 years old and I come from Annecy 🏔 I would describe myself as a dynamic, caring and ambitious person 😊 I particularly enjoy spending time with my friends, going out and traveling 🗺 My ultimate dream in life is to live in New York because I simply fell in love with this city 🗽

  <p>
  My biggest adventures in life were when I went to Toronto 🇨🇦 and New York 🇺🇸 by myself on immersions programs in order to be fluent in english, and also because I felt the need to discover new horizons. These experiences are my best travel memories, where I have met incredible people. Also, as I am passionnate about travel, I had the opportunity to visit United Kingdom, Morocco, Greece, Tunisia, Portugal, Switzerland, Spain, Malta, Turkey, and Italy. And next September, I am going to Singapore for a whole semester and I can't wait to be there!

  <P>I have been passionate about fashion for a while. What I like about it ? Fashion gives people confidence and empowerment. Later in life, I see myself working in this sector after graduating from ESSEC and doing my Master degree.

  <h2>DANCING 💃</h2>
  <p>
  From now on, I have been practicing modern dancing for more than 12 years. I particularly enjoy dancing with my friends and create new choreographies. Though, because of COVID, it is hard to practice, but I am looking forward to dance again once the sanitary situation will be over.
